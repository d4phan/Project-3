          <h4>Analysis Overview</h4>
          <p>
            Our group decided to look at the dataset individually, brainstorming ideas on our own. We created our own graphs that demonstrated patterns we saw in the data.
            We compared our discoveries to one another and saw some similiarities like the how temperatures were increasing in coastal regions. We wanted to explore the idea of dry heat
            as temperatures increased and rainy days decreased. We all discussed the best ways to demonstrate our question. Because we wanted to explore different coasts across the globe,
            we decided to use a map with dots on each region. We used a color saturation scale to represent the different changes in temperature, a visual encoding that uses cognitive work.
            As viewers click through different regions, a graph displaying the relationship between precipitation and temperature is displayed. Because position on a common scale is the most effective
            visual channel, we knew we wanted to incorporate it somewhere in our visualization. We used colors like blue to not only represent precipitation, but to show the negative relationship in rainy days over time. We
            also represent temperature in red to emphasize the increasing temperature across all regions. We initially wanted to display the reltionship between precipitation and temperature through an interactive graph like the one from 
            our D3 lectures, but we recognized this pattern across all regions, so we decided to incorporate a map as well.
            We all spent our own time understanding the dataset and finding topics to explore because we wanted to create as many ideas as possible. Some members took longer than others to understand the complex dataset. 
            After creating our visualizations, we were able to collaborate and spend equal times on the project. Generally, the largest time sink was understanding the dataset and creating a proposition with it. 
            The amount of data was overwhelming, but after understanding it, the magnitude of data was a buffer.
